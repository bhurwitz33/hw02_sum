## Exercise (Picnic)

This week, we are going on a picnic! And collecting all of the food we will bring with us in a Python list.

Lists are a lot like strings, that we learned about last week. But, a big difference between them is that lists are mutable. This means that the contents of the list can be changed, unlike strings, which are immutable (where you have to redefine the entire string if you want to change it). So, what does mutable mean? You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.

This week, we will learn how to use the append and extend methods to add a new element to the end of a list. Or add an element to a list in a specific position, using the insert method.

Next, we will learn how to remove items in a list using the remove method. The remove method takes an element as a parameter, and removes the first occurrence of that element. But watch out! If the element isn’t found in the list, you’ll get a ValueError explaining that the element was not found in the list.

Lastly, we will learn how to remove elements from a list using the pop method. This method differs from the remove method in that it takes an index as a parameter, and returns the element that was removed. This can be useful if you don't know what the value is, but you know where it’s located. This can also be useful when you need to access the data and also want to remove it from the list. For example, we might want to remove the last item we added to a list.

Once we have learned how to change elements in a list, we will go one more step to learn about sorting the elements in a list. Watch out! We will get into some important differences between the list.sort() and list.reverse() methods, compared to the sorted() and reversed() functions. It is important to remember that the sorted() function doesn't change the original list, but list.sort() does.

Next, we will learn how to iterate through these lists using conditional branching with if/elif/else. And get more practice with using conditionals to handle elements in a list differently.

## Homework (sum.py)

You will put everything you've learned to the test in the graded homework assignment and for the practice quiz. In this week's homework you will get a chance to write a program that sums up a set of numbers from the user, and prints and addition statement. Will you use lists? Conditionals? I can't wait to see how you solve it.
